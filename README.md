# Add HTTPS

It adds/removes https to/from the current URL.

If you're on a http site, clicking on this button will take you to the https version. If you're already on https you will be taken to the http version.

Install to firefox from [Firefox Add-ons site](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/add-https/). Just ported to webextensions from old add-ons sdk.
